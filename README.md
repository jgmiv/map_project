# map_project

# Introduction:

This project was to learn how to use [Google Map's](https://www.google.com/maps) API and one more API.  Naturally I chose [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_media_APIs) due to using it in the class.  Also, we learned how to bind html elements to our `javascript` using `knockout.js` which makes updates to the DOM almost instatneously. This project took our `catclicker` project to a whole new level.  

# Details:

We took the `catclicker` code and revamped it utilizing API's from 2 different scources to create a map that is functional and 
interesting.  

# Files details:

`neighborhood.html`- file contains the html code.
`js/app.js`- file contains the well designed model veiw veiw model architecture with knockout bindings.
`css/map.css` contains the header, color and font properties that are applied to the project.
